## Imputation Feasibility Testing for Scales

This repo contains programs that help identify sufficient conditions for successful imputation of scales with mi impute chained.

The repo is still a bit messy but we are working on cleaning it up


## Contents of this repo

### Working programs

* core-programs.ado      : core simulation programs that are currently under development
* scales.ado             : file for creating cummulative distributions of scale items

### Drafts

* diagnostic-tools.ado   : draft of programs to identify problems with data
* scale-preprocessing.ado: a draft scale item cleaning utility

### Older scripts

* myvcov.ado             : *old script* for simulating binary and multi-category items
* binary.ado             : *old script* for simulating binary variables

## Testing script

* test.do                : file for testing with working examples
